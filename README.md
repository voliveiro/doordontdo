I created this simple web app to help me decide whether to take on extra engagements. 

To see what it looks like, visit: https://voliveiro.github.io/doordontdo/. 

Version 2's changes: 
- Adjusts language of questions;
- Allows user to choose how to weight each question; 
- Inserts a 'maybe' option to prevent a binary choice;
- The score for each question is the product of the weight chosen and the answer; 
- The total score sums the score each question; 
- The maximum score possible for each question is the product of the weight and a 'yes' answer;
- The final score is the percentage of the total score over the maximum score possible; 
- 'Do' requires a final score of 66%.
