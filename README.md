I created this simple web app to help me decide whether to take on extra engagements. 

To see what it looks like, visit:

Some information about the tool: 
- Allows user to choose how to weight each question; 
- The score for each question is the product of the weight chosen and the answer; 
- The total score sums the score each question; 
- The maximum score possible for each question is the product of the weight and a 'yes' answer;
- The final score is the percentage of the total score over the maximum score possible; 
- 'Do' requires a final score of 66% - to reflect the necessity of a clear choice in favour of 'Do'. 

The biggest change in the final edition of this project: using JS to loop over the results of each question, rather than taking in values line by line.
