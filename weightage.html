        <p> The questions are heavily weighted in favour of questions 1 and 2. </p>

        <p> Answering "no" to question 1 will result in a "Don't Do" - the sum of points for Questions 2 to 8 is only 15.</p>

        <p> Answering "yes" to question 2 will require favourable responses to all other questions in order to yield a qualified 'Do' at 16 points - that is, do, but only if other commitments are re-prioritised. </p>

        <p> To get a stronger "Do" (i.e. more than 16 points), at least one other question has to be answered favourably to strenghten the case for making the commitment.</p>
