        <p> I've set the final score for 'do' at 66% to reflect the idea that there should be strong positives in favour of commitment. </p>

        <p> The score for each question is the product of the answer and the weight. The maximum score possible for each question is the product of a 'yes' and the weight. </p>

        <p> So, for example, if the weight chosen is 'Very Important' (3 points) and the answer chosen is 'Maybe' (2 points), then the score is 3 (3x1) and the maximum possile score is 6 (3x2). </p>

        <p> The total score is the sum of all scores. The total maximum score is the sum of all maximum scores. The final score is a percentage of the former over the latter. </p>

        <p> The form displays the score rounded down to the nearest whole number.</p>
